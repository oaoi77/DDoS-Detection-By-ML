- Reconstructure to research part and implement part
    + research part:
        - previous code for research: extracting, labeling, testing with model:
            + Logistic Regression
            + Random Forest
            + SVM
        - evaluate accuracy for these model
    + implement part:
        - Folder model:
            + model_initialization:
                - Transforming from pcap to csv (Please modify the path of pcap file before using further)
                - Extracting to 30 features,
                - Labeling (+1 feature "label")
                - Preprocessing: remove unneeded columns('Flow ID', 'Src IP', 'Src Port', 'Dst IP', 'Dst Port'), encoding categorical columns
                - Training model (Random Forest) and output file model.joblib
                ** To modify model_initialization process:
                    ** Please modify the python file model_initialization.py (changing model, ...)
                ** To run model_initialization process:
                    ** Please running the <<model_initialization.sh>>
            + model in_working:
                - Writing python file to load initialized model, predict label (ATTACKER / BENIGN), and output attacker ip addresses to csv file
            + system:
                - The entire system to run:
                    + Capturing pcap file for each 5s
                    + Performing batch process for each pcap file in 5s:
                        - Transforming to csv file
                        - Extracting to csv file (30 features)
                        - Preprocessing (removing, encoding)
                        - Predicting with model
                        - Outputing attacker ip to
                ** To run the system:
                    ** Please running the <<core_instructions.sh>>
